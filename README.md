### 2D Array Traversal

- An iterator that implements the traversal could be found in the `array2d.Array2dIterator` class.
- The `array2d.Main` class shows an example of how to use the iterator and print the result.
- Unit tests could be found in `array2d.Array2dIteratorTest`.

#### Suggestion for improvements

- Make the iterator generic to handle 2D arrays of any type not just ints.
